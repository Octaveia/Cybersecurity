# Programming career cover letter

About 10 years ago I switched from serious Interest in the Linux operating system to programming

The forst reql peofram that I wrote was an arbitrary precision division function. I gad experimented some with qriting parts of of /bin such as "dd" and "cp" as well as program to say latge numbwrs out loud. ie; 2044 as two thousand forty three. 

My father was sort lf a crackshot with some math problems and could miltiply six digit numbers in his head. After researching the history of mathematics i had found that a request for a division algorithm saying it was quite difficult. 

i was not a very good at math as a child and so the haitory of it appealed to me. studying people like newton ended up vwry exciting, and, indeed he is a role model of mine to this day. 

At that time, I had not developed a concept of numerical literacy and as such believed that numbers like pi grow. pi had a tail and depending on how smart you were it couls get very long! The division had a critical bug incould jot fogure out. My girlfriend was reading an ancient mIncan manuscript for her PhD studies and O noted that the number for zero eas different. it was a turtle shell. Turtles all the way down i thought! i utiliEd thjs concept of zeros being empty shells or. array indices instead of being the same as the pther numbers. the bug was fixed. 

The algorithm was based on ling division and was written with no reference material of any type. It was actually good enough it turns out to have been usable for most of computing hostory. it does mot however work for numbers with kore than 10 thousand digits.
