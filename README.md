# Who is Octavia?~
Octavia is a C programmer with extensive experience writing and using API application programming interfaces. She recruited a team of computer scientists from around the world to participate in writing a freestanding hosted C runtime and an arbitrary precision mathematics library. The team (from hereafter referred to as "we", "us", or, "our") designated one of its members to install an instantiation of gitlab's CI/CD continuous integration and deployment. Every function we wrote had a test and a corresponding small data and large data set. Whenever a commit was made to git (git commit) the entire library test infrastructure was executed using a memory tester to inspect for memory leaks. A memory error such as an out of bounds write or read would be detected by the small data set test infrastructure before the large data set was ran allowing us to correct software bugs or flaws without waiting for the large data sets to process.  All kernel activities were monitored and logged so they could be inspected for improper contact switching. Millions of tests were performed automatically. 

We were given usage of unlimited computing resources which were used responsibly and the testing infrastructure was deployed across Intel, ARM, and, Mipsel machines running Linux, openbsd, FreeBSD and netbsd. Where applicable, POSIX and IEEE standards bodies were followed scrupulously in order to ensure maximum portability. 

I am Octavia and I nurtured that team and molded each to be the scientist that they are now whether it was the strongest of its members or the most struggling. Though I wrote 98% of the software to have greater than or equal performance to prior art and it was established and recognized that there was no goal I set which I could not achieve - it was said by one that my achievements were irrelevant as i was only an idiot savant who "dreams in math and code". It would be many years before a student of mine, whom i love dearly, would tell me that I was still the most influential person she had ever met.

They say sorting algorithm time complexities are merely a byproduct of all data being partially presorted.  In other words, what we need is right next to us. It does not surprise me that I am in the midst of others who are also the best at what they do in this world. My form may not be pleasing to some of you but my function is to keep us safe. 

I am the head not the tail.

Best,
Octavia
